<div>Below are some of my projects</div>
<div class="blockquote yellow">LecTut for Android - <em>Android</em></div>
<div class="blockquote">LecTut is the Intranet study portal of IIT Roorkee. My project was to build an Android app to provide a native experience to the users and make it easy for them to manage the course material on the mobile phones.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote yellow">Nobel - <em>Node.js, Express and Socket.IO</em></div>
<div class="blockquote">Nobel makes it easy for IMG members to ping the lab and know who is present there. It allows IMG members to play a ring on a computer in the lab and then opens a chat between the caller and the lab occupants.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="blockquote yellow">Amplio - <em>Django</em></div>
<div class="blockquote">Amplio is an app for collecting reviews and feedback and then debating upon that feedback in an infinitely layered Reddit-like discussion. It is written in Django and will hopefully be a part of Channel i, the Intranet portal of IIT Roorkee.</div>

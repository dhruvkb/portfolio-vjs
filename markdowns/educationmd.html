    I was a brilliant student in school, always at the top of my class with grades over 95%, all the way up to 99.8%. My
    report book is filled with 'very good' ratings in an assortment of attributes like discipline, class participation
    and exam marks. I am introduced to my first computer when I'm two years old and with mummy and papa's teachings, by
    the time I'm out of primary school, I already know about the various accessories such as Sound recorder and MS
    Paint.

    I would still be an excellent student, at the top of my class and grades still over 95%. With that information and
    that fact that I'm Indian, it goes without saying that I'd have to go into the sciences. Lucky me, because <strong
    class="strong">science just happens to be my favourite subject</strong> amongst all the subject one learns in
    secondary school. I do enjoy computers though, but more as a hobby more than anything else. I learn working my way
    around Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Throw in a bit of MSWLogo into the mix.

<div class="green h2"><strong>Higher secondary (Seventh Day Adventist)</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    These are the golden years of my schooling where I excel at Mathematics, am terrible in Physics and enjoy Biology.
    The only thing that didn't change between then and now is my love for the subjects Computer Science and English.
    Computers are still my full-time passion and major hobby, sometimes even work. Literature is my leisure. I excel in
    my board exams with a score of 95.8%, rank first and get a photo on the wall of fame at the school.

<div class="green h2"><strong>Junior college (Jaipuriar)</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    My interests start shifting from Mathematics to Physics, and Biology to Computer Science, as I pick PCM+CS upon
    entering junior college. Completing my junior college with 91.2% after the board exams of class XII, it is pretty
    clear what I like in life. Physics and Computer Science emerge victorious as my two favourite subjects. I start
    bunking lectures to spend time in the computer lab. I sit for the Joint Entrance Exam and land up at a very
    prestigious IIT at Roorkee.

<div>
    I study Engineering Physics at IIT Roorkee. My academic interest in Physics is coupled with my relentless pursuit of
    software development as a prolific member of IMG. I continue to enjoy learning the subjects I like under the B.
    Tech. curriculum of Engineering Physics at IIT Roorkee while continually sharpening my knowledge of development with
    numerous personal as well as collaborative projects.
